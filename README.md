# Kata-Composition
A kata that focuses on the difference between inheritance and object composition.


**Q**: Which are the drawbacks and benefits to each?

**A**: Inheritance is used when there is a clear 'is a' relationship between two classes. It can be used to enforce certain rules to the child classes and keep them tightly coupled. Whereas, composition allows flexibility and reusability. It is used to define a 'has a' relationship between classes. Using composotion makes the code as less coupled as possible and easily maintainable. 


**Q**: Which one would you rather build on in the future?
**A**: I would try and build my classes through composition. This will allow me to ensure my code us reusable and maintainable for a long time. After implemented the HighPassSummingAggregator through composition, I realised how much easier it was to combine multiple classes and implement them with minimal and simplified code.

**Q**:Which one achieves better "reusability"?
**A**: Although inheritance aims to provide reusability from parent classes to their children, inheritance doesn't form this constraint and any code through out the relationship can be reused anywhere thus achieving better reusability.
